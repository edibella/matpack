# Matpack

A command line tool for quickly starting a new matlab package, or a notebook that uses npm for its Matlab package management.

# Status

Planning to create this tool, doesn't do anything at the moment. It's starting at version 2.0.0 because I messed up a couple of things while learning and accidentally pushed out the wrong version number. Oh well.
